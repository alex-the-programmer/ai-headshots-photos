# Simulator Detection Fix

## Issue
The package selection screen was not working correctly in the simulator after asynchronous validation was introduced. The app needed to bypass the package selection process when running in a simulator.

## Solution
Modified `components/packageSelection/packageCard.ios.tsx` to:

1. Import the Device module from expo-device:
```typescript
import * as Device from "expo-device";
```

2. Add a simulator detection check:
```typescript
const isSimulator = !Device.isDevice;
```

3. Add a conditional flow at the beginning of the `onPress` function to bypass package selection when running in a simulator:
```typescript
if (isSimulator) {
  console.log("PackageCard: Running in simulator, bypassing package selection");
  try {
    const choosePackageResult = await choosePackage({
      variables: {
        projectId: projectId,
        packageId: packageNode.id,
      },
    });
    
    console.log("PackageCard: Choose package result in simulator", choosePackageResult);
    
    router.push({
      pathname: "/stylesSelection",
      params: {
        projectId,
      },
    });
    return;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error in simulator flow:", error);
  }
}
```

## Testing
- The app should now bypass the package selection process when running in a simulator
- The app should navigate directly to the styles selection screen after choosing a package in the simulator
- The app should still go through the normal flow when running on a physical device

## Notes
- `Device.isDevice` returns `true` for physical devices and `false` for simulators/emulators
- Added console logs for debugging purposes
- Removed the `observerMode` property from the RevenueCat configuration as it was causing a linter error
